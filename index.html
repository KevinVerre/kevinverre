						<b>Software Engineering</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						I've been writing code since high school. I studied Computer Science for four years at the University of Illiois. After graduation I moved to Silicon Valley for work. My favorite thing about software engineering is building software that people really love to use and are grateful for. I care a lot about the user experience, fixing bugs and making improvements so that people really love the software that I help build.
					</p>
					<p>
						Lately I've been writing code mostly in Ruby, JavaScript, Java and HTML/CSS. But I've also written code in Python, Objective-C, PHP, Perl, C#, Bash scripting, C/C++, ActionScript. I try to learn new languages or frameworks or tools every once in a while.

						<b>Hackathon parties!</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Lately I've been throwing a bunch of "hackathon" events + parties. I have one every 6-8 weeks on a Saturday. It starts out with hanging out at my place in the afternoon. We call it a hackathon because guests are invited to work on stuff on their laptops if they want. It becomes like a chill co-working space. Then we go out to dinner somewhere near by. Then we hang out afterwards. They are a lot of fun. Ask me for an invite. Usually about 20 people stop by.

					<p>
						Many software engineers use Git. But it's difficult to learn and there are lots of useful tricks. I wrote this guide to teach it better. Good for people who are just starting to learn Git or want to learn more about it.

						 I wrote a non-fiction book and made a little website for the book. It's collection of my thoughts on several different topics: school, work, dating. It's the book I wish someone had given me to read! You can read the book online via this website. I'll try to make small updates every once in a while.

						 Every day I spend at least 15 minutes online trying to help people with depression. Usually it's via the Depression subreddit on Reddit. You can read more about this wonderful project at this website that I made for it.

						I made a little website to help people examine their thoughts. It's designed to help you with stress, worry, or anxiety. It gives you questions to consider related to whatever you're worried about. Hopefully you see the problem a little bit differently after using this tool. Inspired mostly by writings by Byron Katie.

						I made a very simple educational website that I thought was a neat idea. It's supposed to inspire visitors to learn about things through Google. It generates all the links from a text list using JavaScript.
