						<b>Hackathon parties!</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Lately I've been throwing a "hackathon" event (and party) ever two months or so. A bunch of people come over in the afternoon and it becomes a little co-working space. Then we go out to dinner and hang out. They are a lot of fun. Ask me for an invite.

						Many software engineers use Git. But it's difficult to learn and there are lots of useful tricks. I wrote this guide to teach it better.

						I made a little website to help people examine their thoughts. It's designed to help you with stress, worry, or anxiety. It gives you questions to consider related to whatever you're worried about. Inspired mostly by writings by Byron Katie.

						I made a very simple educational website that I thought was a neat idea. It's not much yet though. It's supposed to inspire visitors to learn about things through Google.

						<b>Other Hobbies</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						I have a bunch of hobbies that I'm into. Besides listening to music, I enjoy writing music and playing piano. Lately, I've gotten really interested in psychology and trying to help people with depression. I absolutely love watching basketball, my favorite sport. I like reading non-fiction books and I love educational computer games. I like videogames, comic strips, and dancing.
